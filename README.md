Student Habits & Academic Performance Analysis

Project Overview

This project conducts an in-depth analysis of a synthetic dataset containing 80,000 student records to explore how behavioral, psychological, and socio-economic factors influence academic performance and dropout risk.
Technologies & Tools Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
  
- Feature Engineering & Normalization: StandardScaler

Project Workflow

ðŸ”¹ Data Cleaning & Preparation

âœ” Ensured data integrity by correcting types and handling missing values using Pandas & NumPy

âœ” Established a structured and reliable dataset for analysis

ðŸ”¹ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

âœ” Leveraged Matplotlib & Seaborn to create histograms, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps

âœ” Identified key patterns in study habits, mental health, and academic outcomes

ðŸ”¹ Feature Engineering

âœ” Designed new features integrating psychological metrics (stress & exam anxiety)

âœ” Enhanced model accuracy by refining predictive variables

ðŸ”¹ Predictive Modeling

âœ” Developed Logistic Regression models for dropout risk classification

âœ” Trained Random Forest Regressor models for predicting exam scores

ðŸ”¹ Model Evaluation

âœ” Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, recall (classification)

âœ” Validated regression models using RMSE, RÂ²

ðŸ”¹ Feature Importance Analysis

âœ” Identified key indicators of student success and dropout likelihood

âœ” Provided actionable insights for academic interventions

ðŸ”¹ Project Saving & Management

âœ” Applied StandardScaler for data normalization

âœ” Followed best practices for data and model preservation

âœ” Ensured reproducibility and scalability for future research
